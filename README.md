# Autonomous-Agents-Unity-
C# Unity Simulation Project


This project utilizes two sets of autonomous agenst, programed to interact with each other in various ways.

These agents contains methods that simulate pursuiting, evasion, separation, obstacle avoidance, wandering, boundary checking, and debug lines.

These methods are demonstrated with the beetle and ant models, the beetles will attempt to avoid the ants and the ants will persuit the beetles. Both agensts will avoid obsticals and stay within the boundery lines. Once a beetle collides with an ant, the beetle will be destroyed and replaced with a new ant. 


User Controls: 
This project also uses vector interpolating (Lerping) to allow the user to freely use the scroll wheel for camera control. The user may use the arrow keys to rotate the camera, hit the D key to toggle debug mode and hit the E key to refocus the camera.


Models:
All models were not made by me, they were downloaded from these links.
